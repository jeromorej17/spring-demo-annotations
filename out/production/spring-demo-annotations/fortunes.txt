I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling, I've felt all its favours and found its decay
When fortune turns against you, even jelly breaks your teeth
The day of fortune is like a harvest day, We must be busy when the corn is ripe
Fortune may raise up or abuse the ordinary mortal, but the sage and the soldier should have minds beyond her control
There is a brighter day at the end of the rainbow
